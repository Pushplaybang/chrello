cheap as chips trello for one with meteor

## What?
Inspired by my favourite management tool, the awesome and incredible **Trello** I've
built a tiny demo meteor app in a few hours of hacking on sunday afternoon, to see if I could replicate the basic interactions of creating **lists and cards with drag and drop ordering**. Its not super clean, but its just a prototype of the interaction I needed for another meteor app I'm building.

It will serve as a good reference point for get sortable lists done with ordering if thats what you're after.
